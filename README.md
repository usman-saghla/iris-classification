# Iris Species Classification

A machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into three species using logistic regression. This project demonstrates the complete data science workflow from data exploration to model evaluation and prediction.

## üìä Dataset

The project uses the famous **Iris dataset** which contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species:
- **Iris-setosa**
- **Iris-versicolor** 
- **Iris-virginica**

### Features
- `sepal_length`: Length of the sepal in cm
- `sepal_width`: Width of the sepal in cm
- `petal_length`: Length of the petal in cm
- `petal_width`: Width of the petal in cm

### Dataset Statistics
- **Total samples**: 150
- **Features**: 4 numerical features
- **Target classes**: 3 species (50 samples each)
- **No missing values**: Clean dataset ready for analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

## üìà Model Performance

The logistic regression model achieved excellent performance:

- **Accuracy**: 100.00% on test set
- **Precision**: 1.00 for all classes
- **Recall**: 1.00 for all classes
- **F1-Score**: 1.00 for all classes

### Confusion Matrix
```
[[10  0  0]
 [ 0  9  0]
 [ 0  0 11]]
```

Perfect classification with no misclassifications on the test set!

## üî¨ Methodology

### 1. Data Exploration
- Loaded and examined the dataset structure
- Generated summary statistics using `describe()`
- Checked for missing values (none found)
- Created scatter plots to visualize feature relationships

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Separated features (X) and target variable (y)
- Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
- Used `random_state=42` for reproducible results

### 3. Model Training
- Implemented Logistic Regression classifier
- Set `max_iter=200` for convergence
- Trained on 120 samples, tested on 30 samples

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Calculated accuracy score
- Generated classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score
- Created confusion matrix visualization
- Performed manual prediction testing

### 5. Prediction Capability
- Implemented manual input prediction system
- Tested with custom feature values
- Provided confidence scores for predictions

## üíª Usage

### Running the Notebook
1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook iris-classification.ipynb
   ```

3. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis

### Making Predictions
You can modify the manual prediction section in the notebook to test with your own iris measurements:

```python
# Example prediction
sepal_length = 5.1
sepal_width = 3.5
petal_length = 1.4
petal_width = 0.2

# The model will predict the species
```

## üìä Key Insights

1. **Perfect Classification**: The model achieves 100% accuracy, indicating the iris species are highly separable based on the four measurements.

2. **Feature Importance**: All four features (sepal and petal dimensions) contribute to accurate classification.

3. **Data Quality**: The dataset is clean with no missing values, making it ideal for machine learning.

4. **Model Reliability**: The logistic regression model is simple yet highly effective for this classification task.
